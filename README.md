# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML. The game interface includes a game status display, a form to reset the game, and a table to display the game board.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file starts with the doctype declaration and the opening html tag. Inside the html tag, there is the head section and the body section. The head section contains the title of the game. The body section contains the game status, a form to reset the game, and a table to display the game board.

## Styling

The styling of the game interface is done using CSS. The body has a background color, margin, and padding. The h1 tag has text alignment and color. The form has text alignment and margin. The button has a background color, text color, padding, border, border radius, cursor, and font size. The table has margin and border-collapse. The td (table cell) has width, height, text alignment, vertical alignment, font size, background color, and border. The td:hover (hover effect) changes the background color.

## Dynamic Content

The game status is displayed using the `{{ game_status }}` variable. The form action attribute is set to "/reset" to reset the game. The button inside the form is used to submit the form and play again. The table is dynamically generated using a for loop. The row and col variables are used to generate the input fields and buttons for each cell. The `board[row][col]` variable is used to display the current value of each cell.

## Note

This code is a template and may require integration with a backend server to handle game logic and data.
